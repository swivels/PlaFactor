# Accelerating the Computation of weights of Candidate Factors using C++, OpenMP and CUDA  

## Overview
This project aims to accelerate the computation of weights of candidate factors in logic synthesis using C++, OpenMP, and CUDA. 
Parallelizing this computation is beneficial as it significantly reduces the runtime, especially in scenarios where timing goals are not as stringent, such as ASIC prototyping.
It is designed to handle large datasets efficiently.

I am not finished parallelzing everything yet.
